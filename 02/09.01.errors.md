## Errors

[Slides](https://sibin.github.io/teaching/csci2410-gwu-systems_programming/fall_2023/slides/reveal_slides/errors.html#/)

Sometimes, errors happen...

- *e.g.,* system is out of memory
- when we call <sc>malloc</sc>

The first question is how we can detect that some error occurred within a function we have called?

**When errors occur**

- we want more **context**
    - what was the *exact* error?
    - *where* did the error occur?
- programmers can make *informed* choices
    - on how to respond

### **return** vals  &rarr; indicate errors

|functions return|error indicator|example|
|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| integers|negative values|<sc>printf()*</sc>|
| pointers | <sc>NULL</sc>|<sc>malloc()</sc>|
| structs|fields in struct|user defined|
||||

\[*check out the return value of `printf()`\]

As seen above, we separate functions into two different classes:

1. *Functions that return pointers.*
    Functions that return pointers (e.g. that have declarations of the form `type *fn(...)`) are often relatively straightforward.
	If they return `NULL`, then an error occurred; otherwise the returned pointer can be used.
	`malloc` is an example here.
2. *Functions that return integers.*
    Integers are used as a relatively flexible indication of the output of a function.
	Is it common for a `-1` to indicate an error.
	Sometimes *any* negative value indicates an error, each negative value designating that a different error occurred.
	Non-negative values indicate success.
	If a function wishes to return a binary success or failure, you'll see that many APIs (counter-intuitively) return `0` for success, and `-1` for failure.

It is common that you want more information than a *single* return value can give you. So, we can define our own struct,
```c DNE
struct ret_type{
    int a;
    char* carray ;
    unsigned int error_number ;
    char error_name[255] ;
} ;
```


### `errno` variable and command

UNIX/C have some mechanisms that actually help (instead of defining our own structs). They define a **variable**, `errno`, defined in `<error.h>`.

`errno` is simply an integer where specific values represent specific errors. You can view these values by looking them up in the source^[for example, in `/usr/include/asm/errno.h`.]. 

Or, you can ask the `errno` *program*^ (yes, the same name, confusing!), the command line utility (you might need to do `apt-get install moreutils` to get the `errno` program to work if you're using your own system) used as follows:

```c DNE
$ errno 12 
``````

Output:
```c DNE
ENOMEM 12 Cannot allocate memory
```

You can imagine why this error might occur -- your system ran out of memory or you asked for too much!

If we want to see a **full** list of all possible `errno` values and their meanings, we do:

```c DNE
$ errno -l
``````

Output (prints **all** of the error numbers and codes):

### Additional Helper Functions

The C standard library includes two additional helper functions for dealing with errors: 

| function | operation | defined in |
|----------|-----------|------------|
|`perror()` | **print** an error to the console, corresponding to <sc>errno</sc>| `error.h` |
|`strerror()` | **return** a **string** corresponding to <sc>errno</sc>| `string.h`|
||||

Check out their `man` pages for more information.

Consider the following example for understanding the use of `perror()` and `strerror()`:

```c
/* CSC 2410 Code Sample 
 * intro to error handling in C
 * Fall 2023
 * (c) Sibin Mohan
 */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <error.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <limits.h>

int main()
{
    // try to create an array of LONG_MAX size, 
    // i.e. 9223372036854775807 bytes!
    char* massive_array = (char*) malloc(LONG_MAX) ;

    // Check if array was created
    if( !massive_array )
    {
        // Uh oh! Looks like Array creation failed. 
        // print the errno
        printf( "errno = %d\n", errno ) ;

        // Send custom error message and also print system message
        perror( "My Massive Array creation failed!" ) ;
    }

    // can set errno explicitly
    errno = 100 ;
    char* error_string = strerror(errno) ;
    printf( "\nerrno = %d\t (standard) String = %s\n", errno, error_string ) ;

    // can give it any input, really
    unsigned int my_errno = 9999 ;
    error_string = strerror( my_errno ) ;
    printf( "\nmy_errno = %d\t (custom) String = %s\n", my_errno, error_string ) ;

    printf("\n") ;
    return 0 ;
}
```

**Note:** look up [`<limits.h>`](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/limits_h.htm) that defines some useful constants such as `INT_MAX`, `INT_MIN`, `LONG_MAX`, *etc.*

**Note:** when you return from a program with a non-zero value, it designates that your *program* had an error. This is why we see the `make` error when it runs your program.

### Understand Return Values of UNIX library functions:

Look at the function return values to understand the type (and identify if it is returning an `int` or a pointer).
```
SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       void *malloc(size_t size);
	   ...
```
- Read through the description of the function(s).
- Read through the `RETURN VALUE` and `ERRORS` sections of the man page.
```
RETURN VALUE
       The malloc() and calloc() functions return a pointer to the allocated memory, which is  suitably  aligned  for
       any  built-in type.  On error, these functions return NULL.  NULL may also be returned by a successful call to
       malloc() with a size of zero, or by a successful call to calloc() with nmemb or size equal to zero.
...
ERRORS
       calloc(), malloc(), realloc(), and reallocarray() can fail with the following error:

       ENOMEM Out  of  memory.
	   ...

```

This explains why we got the error we did.


### In-class Exercise | Printing **all** error codes/strings in sequence

Write a *function* named, `print_error_codes()`, to print *all* the error codes and their corresponding strings *in sequence*, in the following format:
```
Error No     String
-------------------
1            Operation not permitted
2            No such file or directory
...
```
