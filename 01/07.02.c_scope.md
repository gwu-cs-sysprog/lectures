# `C` Scoping Rules
[Slides](https://sibin.github.io/teaching/csci2410-gwu-systems_programming/fall_2023/slides/reveal_slides/scoping_headers.html/)



Most things in `C` have **names** (also known as *identifiers*). In fact, most things in `C` have a **name** and a **type**:

Typical things that have names:

* variable names
* function names
* file names
* other resources 
* *e.g.,* network sockets

**Every** identifier in **c** also has a **scope**, *i.e.,* where that identifier is *valid*.

### A slight detour | Declarations and Definitions

Let's talk about: **declaration** vs **definition**.

|declaration|definition|
|--------|--------|    
| associates<br> **name** with **type** |allocates<br> **resources**|
||

Most creation of identifiers are **both**, declarations and definitions, _e.g._,

<img src="figures/scoping/scope-final.png" width="250">

But this not _always_ the case (more on this later). 

Now, look at these simple examples:

|statement|type|
|--------|--------|    
| `int i ; `| definition |
| `double* pd ; `| definition |
| `char name[128] ;`| definition |
| `struct student* student_records[100] ;`| definition |
||

But what about _function declarations_?

```c DNE
// declaration or definition?
double foo( double temp ) ;
```

The above code is a _declaration_ since it associates a name with a type, _i.e.,_ the function name `foo` is being associated with the _type_ of function, _i.e.,_ 

`double ( double ) ;` &rarr; a function that takes a `double` as input and returns a `double`. This type is also known as the **function signature**. 

But if this is a "type", then what is a _definition_ for a function? Remember that a definition allocates resources to a name. For functions, at the programmatic level, the "resource" is the **<font color="darkred">code</font>** or **function body**, _e.g.,_

```c DNE
double foo( double temp )
{
    // code here -- the "resources" for function foo()
    // hence, this is a definition!
}
```

Now, let's get back to discussing the name topic, _scopes_.

## "_local_" scope

The name is only valid inside the **block** where it is defined, _e.g.,_

```c DNE
void foo( double a )
{
    double temperature = a ;
    ...
}
```

The variable name, `temperature` is **only** valid inside function `foo()`. It cannot be accessed from anywhere else, like `main()` or some other function, _e.g.,_

```c DNE
void bar()
{
    temperature = 200.0 ;
}
```
this will fail!

> **Note**: Is it a compile-time, link-time or run-time failure?


In the following example,

```c DNE
for( unsigned int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++i )
{
    double fahrenheit = (temperature * (9/5) + 32 ) ;
    printf( "temperature = %f\t in fahrenheit = %f\n", temperature, fahrenheit ) ;
}
```

the variable `fahrenheit` is _local_ to the `for` block, _i.e.,_ it cannot be accessed outside the `for` block -- not even in other parts of the same function! What happens when you run the following code?

```c DNE
for( unsigned int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++i )
{
    double fahrenheit = (temperature * (9/5) + 32 ) ;
    printf( "temperature = %f\t in fahrenheit = %f\n", temperature, fahrenheit ) ;
}

fahrenheit = 98.5 ;
```

What about `i` in the above example?

Answer: it is local to the `for` block as well so it won't be available once the loop is done.

Note that a "block" can mean many things:
* function
* loop `for`, `while`
* conditional `if...else...`
* even a pair of braces! `{...}`

You can have the _same_ names in _different_ scopes!

```c DNE
int a = 100 ;

if(1)
{
    int a = a*100 ;
    int b = a ;

    printf( "a inside if = %d\n", a ) ;
}

printf( "a outside if = %f\n", a ) ;
```

What is the output for the above code?

As mentioned earlier, blocks can be just _empty braces_!

```c DNE
{
    int a = 9038 ;
    {
        int a = 999999 ;
    }
}
```


## "_global_" scope

These are variables that are defined **outside** of _any_ scope, _i.e.,_ outside of any function or block.

```c DNE
// GLOBAL
double celsius_to_fahrenheit = 9.0/5.0 ;
```

`celsius_to_fahrenheit` is visible **everywhere**!

```c DNE
// GLOBAL
double celsius_to_fahrenheit = 9.0/5.0 ;

double foo( double a )
{
    double temperature = a ;

    for(unsigned int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++i )
    {
        double fahrenheit = ( temperature * celcius_to_fahrenheit ) + 32 ; // using the global
        char name[124] ;
    }
    ...
}

void bar()
{
    // can CHANGE the global ANYWHERE!
    celcius_to_fahrenheit = 5.0/9.0 ;
}
```

In fact, global variables can be accessed in **other files** &rarr; by `extern` keyword which just means that the variable is _defined_ elsewhere.

For instance, let's say we create another file, `scope2.c` with the following,
```c DNE
// DEFINITION 
double real_global_variable = 2.0f ;

double pi = 3.141567 ;
```

and in our main file (say we call it `scope.c`), we do:
```c DNE
// DECLARATIONS! 
extern double real_global_variable ;
extern double pi ;
```

so, now we can access the variables, `real_global_variable` and `pi` **inside `scope.c`**, _i.e.,_ a different file from where they have been defined! Inside `scope.c`, we can use those variables, _e.g.,_
```c DNE
void bar( double radius )
{
    double area = pi * radius * radius ; // using the externally declared variable "pi"
}
```

Let's revisit the **declaratins** vs **definitions** topic. This is a **definition**:

```c DNE 
extern double pi = 3.1415f ;
```

since, it has 

* a name, `pi`
* associated with a type, `double` 
* **resources allocated** &rarr; memory to store a `double`
* also an **initialization** &rarr; `3.1415f`

The following is a **declaration**:
```c DNE
extern double pi ;
```

* a name, `pi`
* is associated with a type, `double` 
* but **<font color="darkred">defined elsewhere</font>**!
    - in `scope2.c`
    - **<font color="darkred">no additional memory allocated</font>**

> What about function **arguments**? Are they local or global?


## "_translation unit_"/"_file_" scope

What if we want...

* an identifier **not** visible to others?
* but global **only to us**, _i.e.,_ global inside our _current_ file only.

This is called _file_ or _translation unit_ scope and we use the **`static`** keyword, as follows:

```c DNE
// GLOBAL but only for US
static double celsius_to_fahrenheit = 9.0/5.0 ;
```
